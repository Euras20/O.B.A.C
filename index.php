                <h2>SAVING ACCOUNT</h2>
                <p>
                A savings account is a secure financial <br>
                tool that allows individuals to deposit money<br>
                while earning interest on their balance.<br>
                It provides a safe way to save for short-term and <br>
                long-term goals, offering liquidity and easy access <br>
                to funds when needed. Savings accounts typically have minimal<br>
                risk and are ideal for building emergency funds<br>
                or saving for planned expenses,<br>
                helping individuals grow their money steadily over time.<br>
                Savings accounts promote financial discipline by limiting <br>
                withdrawals and encouraging regular savings. <br>
                They are crucial for achieving financial goals,<br>
                such as building an emergency fund, saving for large purchases,<br>
                or planning for retirement.<br>

            <div class="Checking">
                <h2>CHECKING ACCOUNT</h2>
                <p>
                A checking account is a fundamental financial tool<br> 
                that facilitates everyday transactions and money management.<br>
                It allows account holders to deposit income, <br>
                pay bills, and make purchases using checks, <br>
                debit cards, or online transfers. Unlike savings accounts,<br>
                checking accounts typically do not accrue interest <br>
                on deposited funds but offer easy access to money <br>
                for daily expenses. They are essential for managing personal finances,providing convenience through features like direct deposits,<br>
                ATM access, and online banking. Checking accounts often come with minimal or no monthly fees, making them a<br>
                practical choice for day-to-day financial activities and budgeting.<br>
                A checking account serves as a versatile financial hub, <br>
                enabling seamless transactions and easy access to funds.<br>
